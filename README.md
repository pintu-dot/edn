# EDN - Edge Dependent Noise
Code and supplementary material as part of the submission to ECMLPKDD 2025 for the paper "EDN: A Novel Edge-Dependent Noise Model for Graph Data".

Implementation of all variants of EDN is available in the file EDN.ipnyb. This file can be used to inject EDN into the dataset and also include a comparative result of the existing noise model and EDN's variants.

rho_values: contains ready-to-refer $\rho$ values for Citeseer, Cora and Amazon Photo datasets.

Hypothesis Testing: contains results related to hypothesis testing.
