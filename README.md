# EDN - Edge Dependent Noise
Code and supplementary material as part of the submission to ESANN 2025 for the paper "EDN: A Novel Edge-Dependent Noise Model for Graph Data".

As the page limit was 6 pages, and the ESANN portal didn't have an option to include supplementary material, we include proofs, derivations and extended results here.
